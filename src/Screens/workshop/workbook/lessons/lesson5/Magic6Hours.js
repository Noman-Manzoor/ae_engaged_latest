                (2-ish minutes per weekday = 10 minutes per week){'\n'}
                Couples should say goodbye before they leave each other in the morning and find out one thing that is happening in their partner’s life that day – lunch plans, important meeting, etc.{'\n'}
                {'\n'}
                <Text style={{ fontSize: 15, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>2 - Reunions</Text>
                {'\n'}

                (20-ish minutes per day = 1 hour, 40 minutes per week){'\n'}
                Couples should greet each other with a hug and kiss that lasts at least 6 seconds – yes, 6 seconds, not 5 seconds. So, this means that our greetings are more than just a peck on the cheek and a side hug. This creates a physiological reaction in our bodies.{'\n\n'}  In addition, couples should have a stress-reducing conversation that lasts about 20 minutes (e.g., don’t talk about the argument you had the night before!). This conversation is meant as a time of reconnection before getting lost in the rest of the day’s happenings. 3 - Admiration and Appreciation (5-ish minutes per day = 35 minutes per week) Spend at least five minutes each day communicating genuine appreciation for your spouse. Try to be a little creative and not always say the same, “thanks for doing the dishes.” It is important that we directly express our admiration and appreciation for our partner and not just assume he or she already knows it. (Our admiration and appreciation don’t necessarily have to be about something that happened that day but can include our whole relationship.) Regular expressions of appreciation are one of the strongest predictors of a healthy, loving relationship.{'\n'}

                <Text style={{ fontSize: 15, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>3 - Affection</Text>{'\n'}
                (5-ish minutes per day = 35 minutes per week){'\n'}
                Couples should be showing each other physical affection daily. Not only does it feel good in the moment, physical affection releases oxytocin in our brains which increases feelings of connection. Physical affection also helps us express desire for our spouse.{'\n'}
                {'\n'}
                <Text style={{ fontSize: 15, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>4 - Weekly Date</Text>{'\n'}
                (2-ish hours per week){'\n'}
                Successful couples devote about two hours per week spending one-on-one time together on a date. Prioritize dates that allow for talking together as friends (not just talking about relationship difficulties). Couples should also try to mix up what they do on their weekly dates and not just do the same routine week after week. Trying to figure out a weekly date can become more complicated over time as schedules become busier and kids are added to the family, but it is incredibly important to intentionally make time for weekly dates. 6 - State of the Union Meeting (1 hour per week) Finally, couples should spend about an hour a week counseling together about how they are doing in their marriage and how they are doing in their shared efforts. This includes doing a relationship check-in (What went right this week? What went wrong? What are our plans for the upcoming week? Long-term future plans? How is our communication? How are things going sexually? How are we prioritizing “we over me?”) It should also include time to address any relationship concerns and to express partner appreciation.
